            <br>
            <p>
              To the left, we have a bar chart showing countries and the number of critically endangered, endangered, 
              or vulnerable species that this country is home to. For the purpose of simplicity, we have only graphed
              countries which have 100 or more at-risk species. Please note that there are a total of 238 countries that
              currently have at-risk species. The chart to the right shows the top 44 countries and their count of species.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              As we can see, it seems the countries whose wildlife is being affected the most are: <ul>
                <li>
                  Indonesia with 535 at-risk species
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ecuador with 411 at-risk species

                <li>
                  Brazil with 389 at-risk species
                </li>
                <li>
                  India with 360 at-risk species
                </li>
                <li>
                  China with 360 at-risk species

              For the purposes of our project, our database contains the following types of species: birds, mammals, 
              and reptiles.

            <h2 class = 'text-center'>Species Populations from 1996-2021 </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              To the right, we have a line chart tracking the population of each type of species from the years 1996 to 2021.
              As shown in the legend in the top left corner of the chart, each line corresponds to the population count for
              birds, mammals, and reptiles with a separateline charting the total population count for all three species 
              types combined. Please refer to the legend for reference.
            </p>
            <p>The default view of this chart is showing the population count for all species currently within the 
              "Critically Endangered" category. <b>Use the dropdown above to show species population counts for species in 
              the "Endangered" and "Vulnerable" categories!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              As we can see, it seems the population for all animal type in the "Critically Endangered" category has increased 
              over time suggesting that although these species are still critically endangered, conservation efforts have 
              made it possible for these species to grow. <br>
              For "Endangered" species, we see a similar upward trend where endangered birds, mammals, and reptiles have
              successfully grown in numbers although still remain endangered. It is important to note that much of this overall
              growth may be due to the sudden increase in endangered reptile populations; as the population count for mammals 
              and birds has remained pretty steady.<br>
              Species in the "Vulnerable" caegory also have an upward trend overall however, in this category we can see that 
              vulnerable mammal populations have took a dip in 2008 and have no been able to recover since. While ir populations 
              seem to remain steady, it seems that reptile populatiions are once again the biggest contribution to the overall 
              uptick in population counts for vulnerable species.  
            </p>

              As a reminder, for the purposes of our project, our database contains the following types of species: birds, mammals, and reptiles.

              To the left, we have a donut chart displaying the most prevalent conservation efforts currently being used to
              combat many of the threats that critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable species are facing. Each of
              these efforts are shown with the percentage describing how often this conservation method is used in relation to 
              our database of species. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Please note that any conservation effort which was utilized 2% or less was placed into the "Other" category for 
              readability purposes. As a reminder, for the purposes of our project, our database contains the following types 
              of species: birds, mammals, and reptiles.

              Below are brief descriptions of the most popular conservation efforts that can be observed in our donut chart:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Site/are protection: Protecting the geographical site where the species lives through legal means. These
                  protected sites are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited public access, 
                  national parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes, and 
                  areas managed mainly for sustainable use. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Site/area management: Management of a protected area that require regular, active interventions to address 
                  the requirements of particular species within the area. For example, protecting vegetation patterns or other 
                  biological features,protecting fragments of habitats as components of landscape or seascape-scale conservation 
                  strategies
                </li>
                <li>
                  Resource and habitat protection: Focus on protecting the habitats in which the at-risk species live in. This 
                  promotes sustainable use of natural resources and social and economic benefits to local communities where 
                  relevant. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Awareness & communications: To develop public education and appreciation of the species and/or habitats 
                  concerned. Communication, Education and Public Awareness are important instruments for conservation and 
                  sustainable use of biodiversity. Motivates people towards mobilizing individual and collective action.
                </li>
